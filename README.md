# Gatsby starter with Tailwind

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-project https://github.com/digitalcentral/gatsby-starter-tailwind
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-project
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Open the `my-project` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
